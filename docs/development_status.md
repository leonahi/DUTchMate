## Resume Here

Read this document first whenever development resumes.

- **Current milestone:** Stage 8 software acceptance has passed review on
  `stage8-phase1-acceptance`. Stage 8 itself
  and Phase 1A/1B/Phase 1 remain **Incomplete** because real v2 HIL is required.
  The service-test state isolation fix is validated and accepted on
  `fix/service-test-session-isolation`. Failed Basic HIL evidence remains
  preserved; no new HIL or physical acceptance occurred.
- **Implementation status:** Enhanced continuous RX/telemetry, per-segment RP2350
  provenance, audited reset/boot, immediate boot preservation, and CLI parity
  pass deterministic acceptance. Obsolete production v0/v1 writers, finite
  reconnect/discard paths, legacy response fallbacks, and single-workflow status
  are removed. Historical read/replay and Debug Agent v1 compatibility remain.
- **Historical evidence:** The ring-buffer decision remains `accepted_32k` for
  its recorded measurements. Existing HIL records were not rewritten or treated
  as current v2 acceptance; Revision A measurement gaps remain open.
- **Next step:** Commit/push the accepted isolation fix, integrate it into
  `stage8-phase1-acceptance`, then rerun Basic HIL from the beginning with all
  software checks completed before starting the physical service.
  Preserve failed session `20261026T134413Z-e8d17b99`; no acceptance carries
  forward from that run. Enhanced HIL, Revision A, and MCP remain pending.
- **Open blockers:** Real Basic HIL remains incomplete. Its ambient
  boot/delayed-fault/follow/Monitor/console/handoff/
  reconnect criteria must be proved in a clean rerun. The earlier physical
  `E_COMMAND_001` INFO anomaly remains an observation to retest, unchanged by
  this software slice. No hardware or serial access occurred on the fix branch;
  the physical service remained stopped. Enhanced/Phase 4 blockers are unchanged.

Update the review date, current milestone, next step, checklist, and concise
validation result in the same commit as each completed development slice. Add
detailed completed-slice and dated validation evidence to
`docs/development_history.md`; do not create another progress tracker.

## Phase 1 v2 Baseline

The approved Phase 1 contract changes the product semantics, so completion under
the earlier contract cannot be carried forward as current Phase 1A/1B acceptance.
The implementation starts from proven components, but target completion must be
demonstrated again against the new normative done criteria.

| Area | Current baseline | Phase 1 v2 status |
|---|---|---|
| Basic and Enhanced physical adapters | Existing backend, protocol, firmware, and HIL evidence is reusable | Historical evidence only; final v2 acceptance remains open |
| DUT Profile and effective serial provenance | One immutable resolved profile owns backend, selector/topology, UART policy, DTR/RTS request, GPIO config, projection, and digest | Stage 1 complete; exposed through runtime/service/CLI status without v2 storage |
| Native session schema v2 | Deterministic v2 store/recovery/retrieval/retention is implemented | Stage 2 complete; production runtime ownership adopted in Stage 3 |
| Continuous ambient evidence recording | One core recorder owns backend receive, durable admission, projections, reconnect transfer, and shutdown/fault terminalization | Stage 3 complete |
| Monitor | Bounded duration/condition observation uses the continuous durable stream with v2 operation lifecycle evidence | Stage 4 complete |
| Interact and audited actions | Exact-byte audited send, exclusive bounded Interact, and audited reset/boot/GPIO Control; higher-level reset/observe procedures are client-composed | Stage 5 complete at `857261b`; live boot-test removed |
| Follow and console | Durable cursor API plus HTTP-only follow and audited line console | Stage 6 complete at `5643c65` |
| Release and reacquire | Explicit ownership lifecycle, durable gaps, Basic line provenance, and safe USB identity matching | Stage 7 Complete |
| MCP target-contract migration | Existing MCP integration exposes pre-v2 service semantics | Deferred until after Phase 1 CLI/HIL acceptance |

Historical sessions and validation records must not be rewritten as though they
never existed. Schema-v0/v1 evidence remains read-only compatibility data under
the new contract.

## Migration Checklist

| Stage | Status | Exit/next action |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — normative baseline and truthful status | Complete | Superseded working baseline retained in history |
| 1 — DUT Profile and provenance | Complete | Effective profile and digest exposed; physical behavior preserved |
| 2 — session schema v2 persistence | Complete | Review findings resolved; deterministic storage contract and compatibility readers validated |
| 3 — authoritative continuous recorder | Complete | Profile-bounded reconnect, provenance, capacity-blocked shutdown drain, boundary-flush, and queue review findings resolved |
| 4 — Monitor | Complete | Review fixes validated; rollover-safe lifecycle, deterministic terminalization, exact-range quality, leased incremental reads, and Monitor-only aliases |
| 5 — audited TX, Interact, Control | Complete | Atomic-capability review committed at `857261b` |
| 6 — durable cursor, follow, console | Complete | Durable snapshots, cursor continuity, and HTTP-only client views reviewed and validated |
| 7 — release/reacquire, DTR/RTS, native USB | Complete | Lifecycle arbitration, cleanup certainty, provenance, and selector behavior reviewed and validated |
| 8 — Enhanced parity, cleanup, CLI/HIL acceptance | Software acceptance baseline retained; HIL incomplete | Test-isolation fix validated and accepted; integrate the fix, then restart Basic HIL from the beginning before Enhanced HIL |
| Post-Phase-1 MCP migration | Deferred | After Phase 1 CLI/HIL acceptance |

Implementation details, invariants, tests, and exit criteria for each stage live
only in the migration plan and normative specification. This checklist records
progress; it does not redefine either document.

## Deferred Work Outside the Active Slice

- Revision A corrected-design and remaining physical measurements are preserved
  as open Phase 1 acceptance evidence for Stage 8.
- Phase 4 Debug Agent evidence packaging remains paused after VS Code host
  acceptance; authenticated Claude Code host validation remains unavailable.
- Public `dutchmate-debug-agent` distribution remains deferred to `v0.2.0`.
- Delivery Infrastructure and the five-distribution `v0.1.0` release remain
  completed historical work; they do not satisfy any Phase 1 v2 semantic gate.

## Current Acceptance Gates

| Gate | Status |
|---|---|
| Phase 1A — Basic | Incomplete; isolation fix validated and accepted; clean Basic HIL rerun required |
| Phase 1B — Enhanced | Software parity accepted; incomplete pending real Pico 2 + fixture v2 HIL and required Revision A physical evidence |
| Phase 1 shared done criteria | Software regressions pass; incomplete until both backend/physical gates pass |

## Current Validation Requirements

Service-test isolation, 2026-10-26: regression demonstrated active→abandoned
before the fix and again with the shared fixture temporarily removed. With
per-test working directories, the external sentinel remains active with all
state bytes/mtimes unchanged; default and explicit production startup recovery
still work. Three new regression cases passed. Focused service/startup/recovery/
architecture gate: 214 passed in 7.24 s. Full pytest: 1,499 passed in 37.13 s.
Ruff, configured mypy (103 source files), offline lockfile check (66 packages),
and `git diff --check` passed. All 424 real `.dutchmate` file hashes and the
failed HIL validation record remain unchanged. Only service-test infrastructure,
regressions, and status/history changed; no production or hardware changes.
Detailed commands/audit are in development history. Prior failed physical
evidence remains in [Basic HIL validation](../hardware/validation/phase1_basic_hil.md).

Stage 8 software validation, 2026-10-26: all 1,491 pytest tests passed (39.58 s),
including the firmware harness and architecture/dependency checks. The focused
acceptance/cleanup/Debug Agent gate passed 23 tests. Ruff, configured mypy (103
source files), offline lockfile check (66 packages), core and Debug Agent sdist/
wheel builds, and `git diff --check` passed. Production wheels exclude test-only
legacy fixture builders. Graphify was refreshed with its existing partial
extraction warning for `fixture_protocol.h` and community-label notice. Discovery
ran only after the software gate passed; no serial connection was opened and no
firmware was flashed. Detailed commands/results live in
[Development History](development_history.md).
